### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am 22 years old, I am studying at the National University of Entre Rios, in the Bachelor's degree in Systems and at the same time I am a Full-stack web developer jr, where I generally stand out for the front-end, although I also have good management from the back-end. I like to keep up to date with new technologies and take courses to reinforce my knowledge.
